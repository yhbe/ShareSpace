ShareSpace is a Facebook inspired social networking web application that allows users to connect with friends, share text-only posts, add comments, and view a newsfeed of their friends' posts. Users can also delete their own posts and comments, and search for new friends to add to their network.

## Getting Started
To get started with ShareSpace, simply sign up for an account and start adding friends. Once you have friends in your network, you can begin sharing text-only posts and adding comments to your own and your friends' posts. You can also delete your own posts and comments at any time.

###  Backend
The backend  is powered by the [ShareSpaceAPI](https://github.com/yhbe/ShareSpaceAPI), a custom built RESTful API


## Features
Here are some of the key features of ShareSpace:

- Send friend requests and approve them
- Make text-only posts
- Add comments
- Delete posts and comments
- Home page shows newsfeed of all your friend's posts and your own
- 'New Users' aside shows newly signed up users to add as friends
- Profile page shows your own posts
- Utilizes token-based authentication to allow users to stay logged in between sessions. This means that once a user logs in, their session will be maintained until they manually log out, even if they close the browser window or navigate away from the site. Tokens are generated and validated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and are stored securely in the user's browser cookies. This allows ShareSpace to provide a seamless and secure user experience.
